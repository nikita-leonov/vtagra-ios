A set of reusable components taking advantage of extra dimension [Attribute-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-oriented_programming) adds.

##Components

**Core** - support for attributes, reflection and helper-extensions on Foundation classes.  
**Services** - implementation of Service Locator pattern, centralized replacement for singletons.  
**Serialization** - attribute-based JSON and XML parsers for easy DOM (de)serializations.  
**Web Services** - attribute-based HTTP client API.  

##Snippet
Connection to the test HTTP server, that returns JSON from headers you send, could look as follows:

	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFWebService, serviceRoot = @"http://headers.jsontest.com/")
	@interface JsonTestWebClient : RFWebServiceClient
	
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFWebServiceCall, method = @"GET", prototypeClass = [MyWebServiceResponse class])
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFWebServiceHeader, headerFields = @{@"Text" : @"A lot of text",
	                                                   @"Number" : [@1434252.234 stringValue],
	                                                   @"Date" : [[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:100000000] description]})
	- (id<RFWebServiceCancellable>)echoRequestHeadersAsJSONWithSuccess:(void(^)(MyWebServiceResponse result))successBlock failure:(void(^)(NSError *error))failureBlock;
	
	@end

then we define the model:

	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFSerializable)
	@interface MyWebServiceResponse : NSObject
	
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFSerializable, serializationKey = @"Text")
	@property NSString *text;
	
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFSerializable, serializationKey = @"Number")
	@property NSNumber *number;
	
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFSerializable, serializationKey = @"Date")
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFSerializableDate, format = @"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z")
	@property NSDate *date;
	
	@end

and make singleton instance of JsonTestWebClient accessible through RFServiceProvider:

	@interface RFServiceProvider (JsonTestWebClient)
	
	RF_ATTRIBUTE(RFService, serviceClass = [JsonTestWebClient class])
	+ (JsonTestWebClient *)jsonTestWebClient;
	
	@end

Now we can use it: 

	[[RFServiceProvider jsonTestWebClient] echoRequestHeadersAsJSONWithSuccess:^(MyWebServiceResponse *result) {
	    NSLog(@"%@", result);
	} failure:^(NSError *error) {
	    NSLog(@"Something terrible happened! Here are details : %@", error);
	}];

##Requirements

ROAD requires **iOS 5.0** and above. The compatibility with **4.3** and older is not tested.

ROAD initially designed to use **ARC**. 

##Jump Start
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the only recommended way of ROAD integration. Besides the standard configuration of pod dependencies, pod_install hook is required as shown below. A typical Podfile will look as follows:

	pod 'ROADFramework'

	post_install do |installer|
	    require File.expand_path('ROADConfigurator.rb', './Pods/libObjCAttr/libObjCAttr/Resources/')
	    ROADConfigurator::post_install(installer)
	end


**Using components separately**  
If you'd like to embed only specific components from the framework it can be done with CocoaPods as well.

	pod 'ROADFramework/ROADServices'
	pod 'ROADFramework/ROADWebService'

Detailed information on internals of ROAD integration as well as advanced topics like integration with predefined workspace, multiple projects or targets is available in [the documentation](./Documents/Configuration/Cocoapods.md).        
        
##Documentation

User documentation for the following components is available in **Documents** folder:

* [Core](./Documents/ROADCore.md)
* [Services](./Documents/ROADServices.md)
* [Serialization](./Documents/ROADSerialization.md)
* [Web Services](./Documents/ROADWebService.md)

Classes reference is available in [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ROADFramework/)

##Contribution

There are three ways you can help us:

* **Raise an issue.** You found something that does not work as expected? Let us know about it.
* **Suggest a feature.** It's even better if you come up with a new feature and write us about it.
* **Write some code.** We would love to see more pull requests to our framework, just make sure you have the latest sources. For more information, check out [the guidelines for contributing](./contributing.md).
